This is a breif description about the autonomous robot vehicle used by team 'Autonomous Buggies' in the aim of participating in WRO2023 competetion - Future Engineers category. 
 

The mechanical, electrical, and electronic parts of the vehicle can be found in the sections listed above.

The codes used to program the vehicle are written in Python and Arduino C.

## Mobility Management
### Vehicle Main Body
The vehicle main body is built using `LEGO`.
The main Micrprocessor in the vehicle is `Raspberry Pi 4 Model b` provided with `Raspberry pi Camera V2.1`.
Main Macrocontroller is Atmega mounted on `Arudino Mega 2060` board.
To ensure the accurate and efficient control and direction of the vehicle’s movement, we employed two crucial components:
- **Servo Motor Model**
- **J Sumo DC Motor**
- **BTS Motor Driver**
The servo motor model was selected for controlling the vehicle’s steering, while the J Sumo DC motor was utilized to provide the necessary power to drive the vehicle’s motion. 

**The characteristics of the DC motor:**
1. The diameter of the motor is 37mm. Length is 75mm.
2. 6mm diameter shaft section, shaft length 17 mm.
3. No load current is 240ma, and stall current is 5.9 Ampere.
4. All Gearhead gears are metal.
5. Motor’s stall torque is 7.5 kg-cm.
### Why JSUMO Motor
If we want to reach a certain velocity, we need first to calculate the equivalent moment of inertia of the vehicle then depending on the time needed to reach the steady state velocity we can find the torque needed to translate the vehicle with the desired velocity. Due to the many components of the vehicle we estimated the equivalent moment of inertia, taking the mass of the vehicle **1.495kg** , wheels radius **28mm**, desired velocity **50cm/s**, steady state reach time **10 millisecond**, we found that the Jsumo DC motor we used that has a stall torque about **7.5kg-cm** is enough to handle the vehicle and make it move by **50cm/s** velocity in a good steady state time.

### The Motion Mechanism 
We used Ackermann steering and to achieve that a servo motor was installed in way that can move the Ackermann freely, while the DC motor (J Sumo 1000 rpm) serves as the driving motor. The kinetic energy generated by the DC motor is transferred to the back wheels through a differential gearbox. The wheels receive this energy via a drive shaft made of LEGO components, which transmits torque to the differential gearbox through a suitable coupler designed and printed by 3D printer using this [model](https://github.com/jaafarmayya/AutonomousBuggies-Team/blob/main/models/Coupler.jpg).

## Power & Sense Management
### Electronic Components
- **Arduino Mega 2560:** The Arduino Mega Board is used to control the DC Motor and the servo motor and receive data from sensor (UltraSonic – MPU). [[2]]() 
- **Raspberry pi 4 Model B:** The Raspberry pi 4 Microprocessor plays a big role in the decision making. It is used to execute the python code and send data to the Arduino board. These data describe the surrounding environment of the vehicle in order to control the vehicle. [[3]]()
- **Raspberry pi camera:** The Raspberry pi camera was used to discover the playfield of the robot and to detect the color of the pillars existed in front of the vehicle. [[4]]()
- **BTS7960 Motor Driver:** The `BTS7960` is a fully integrated high current H bridge module for motor drive applications.[[5]]()
- **3 RioRand LM2596 step-down DC-DC Converter:** DC-DC Buck Converter Step Down Module `LM2596` Power Supply is a step-down(buck) switching regulator, capable of driving a 3-A load with excellent line and load regulation. We used the fixed output 5V. [ [6]]()

- **2 Li-Po RC Batteries 12V:**  Lithium Polymer (Li-Po) batteries are a type of rechargeablebattery that are widely used in remote control cars (RCC) due to their high energy density,lightweight, and ability to deliver high currents. The 12V **2200mAh** Li-Po battery is a popular choice for powering remote control vehicles because it provides a good balance between capacity and weight.[[8]]()
- **J Sumo DC Motor:** [[1]]()
  - The diameter of the motor is 37mm. Length is 75mm.
  - 6mm diameter shaft section, shaft length 17 mm.
  - 6 M3 screw holes on the front side are available.
  - No load current is 240ma, and stall current is 5.9 Ampere.
  - All Gearhead gears are metal.
  - Motor’s stall torque is 7.5 kg-cm.

- **MPU 6050:**  The MPU6050 is a Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) which consists of a 3-axis Accelerometer and 3-axis Gyroscope inside it. This helps us to measure acceleration, velocity, orientation, displacement and many other motions related parameter of a system or object. We used it to measure the yaw of the robot while certain rotations. [[9]]()
