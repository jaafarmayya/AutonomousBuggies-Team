## Mobility Management
### Vehicle Main Body
The vehicle main body is built using `LEGO`.
The main Micrprocessor in the vehicle is `Raspberry Pi 4 Model b` provided with `Raspberry pi Camera V2.1`.
Main Macrocontroller is Atmega mounted on `Arudino Mega 2060` board.
To ensure the accurate and efficient control and direction of the vehicle’s movement, we employed two crucial components:
- **Servo Motor Model**
- **J Sumo DC Motor**
- **BTS Motor Driver**
The servo motor model was selected for controlling the vehicle’s steering, while the J Sumo DC motor was utilized to provide the necessary power to drive the vehicle’s motion. 

**The characteristics of the DC motor:**
1. The diameter of the motor is 37mm. Length is 75mm.
2. 6mm diameter shaft section, shaft length 17 mm.
3. No load current is 240ma, and stall current is 5.9 Ampere.
4. All Gearhead gears are metal.
5. Motor’s stall torque is 7.5 kg-cm.
### Why JSUMO Motor
If we want to reach a certain velocity, we need first to calculate the equivalent moment of inertia of the vehicle then depending on the time needed to reach the steady state velocity we can find the torque needed to translate the vehicle with the desired velocity. Due to the many components of the vehicle we estimated the equivalent moment of inertia, taking the mass of the vehicle **1.495kg** , wheels radius **28mm**, desired velocity **50cm/s**, steady state reach time **10 millisecond**, we found that the Jsumo DC motor we used that has a stall torque about **7.5kg-cm** is enough to handle the vehicle and make it move by **50cm/s** velocity in a good steady state time.

### The Motion Mechanism 
We used Ackermann steering and to achieve that a servo motor was installed in way that can move the Ackermann freely, while the DC motor (J Sumo 1000 rpm) serves as the driving motor. The kinetic energy generated by the DC motor is transferred to the back wheels through a differential gearbox. The wheels receive this energy via a drive shaft made of LEGO components, which transmits torque to the differential gearbox through a suitable coupler designed and printed by 3D printer using this [model](https://github.com/jaafarmayya/AutonomousBuggies-Team/blob/main/models/Coupler.jpg).

- **2 Li-Po RC Batteries 12V:** Li-Po (Lithium Polymer) RC batteries are commonly used in remote control (RC) vehicles, drones, and other hobbyist applications that require a compact and high-capacity power source. While Li-Po batteries are typically available in various cell configurations and voltages, a 12V Li-Po RC battery is not a standard configuration. However, it is possible to create a 12V power supply by combining certain Li-Po battery configurations.

- **Cooling Fan:** The cooling fan is used to cool down the temperature of the Raspberry pi microprocessor.
- **10 UltraSonic Sensors:**
  Ultrasonic sensors are electronic devices that use ultrasonic waves to measure distance or detect objects. They work based on the principle of echolocation, similar to how bats navigate in the dark. Ultrasonic sensors emit high-frequency sound waves (typically above the range of human hearing) and then receive the reflected waves to determine the distance or presence of objects.

  The key characteristics and applications of ultrasonic sensors:

      1. Distance Measurement: Ultrasonic sensors are commonly used for non-contact distance measurement. They typically emit ultrasonic pulses and measure the time it takes for the sound waves to bounce back after hitting an object. By knowing the speed of sound in the medium (usually air), the sensor can calculate the distance to the object.

      2. Object Detection: Ultrasonic sensors can detect the presence or absence of objects within their range. When an object is detected, the sensor receives the reflected sound waves, and based on the intensity or time delay of the received signal, it can determine if an object is present or not.

      3. Range and Accuracy: Ultrasonic sensors can have varying range capabilities, typically ranging from a few centimeters to several meters. The accuracy of distance measurement depends on factors such as the sensor's resolution, beam angle, and environmental conditions.

      4. Ultrasonic Transducer: The core component of an ultrasonic sensor is the transducer, which converts electrical energy into ultrasonic sound waves and vice versa. It consists of a piezoelectric crystal that vibrates when an electrical current is applied, generating the ultrasonic waves.

      5. Beam Pattern: Ultrasonic sensors emit sound waves in a specific beam pattern, usually conical or cylindrical. The beam angle determines the width of the detection area. Narrower beam angles provide more focused sensing, while wider angles cover a larger area but with reduced accuracy.

      6. Environmental Considerations: Ultrasonic sensors are affected by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and air turbulence. These factors can influence the speed of sound and affect the accuracy of distance measurements.

      7. Applications: Ultrasonic sensors are widely used in various fields, including industrial automation, robotics, automotive, security systems, level monitoring, parking assistance, liquid flow measurement, and presence detection in consumer electronics.[[10]]()

#### Computer Vision
How the robot recognizes the surrounding area?
We developed a Python script that uses computer vision techniques to detect the presence of a
red or green pillar in front of a camera. The script captures video frames from a camera using the
OpenCV library, processes each frame to isolate regions that match the color of a red or green
pillar, and then applies contour detection to identify the location and size of the detected region.
Here is a brief explanation of the code:
* The script imports several libraries, including OpenCV, NumPy, time, and serial.
* It initializes a serial connection to communicate with an external device.
* It initializes the camera capture using OpenCV’s VideoCapture function.
* It sets up the color ranges for the red and green pillars in the HSV color space using NumPy arrays.
* It enters a loop that captures frames from the camera, processes them, and detects the presence of a red or green pillar in each frame.
* The loop extracts a region of interest from the frame, applies a mask to isolate the pixels that match the color range of the red or green pillar, and performs morphological operations to remove noise from the binary mask.
* The script then applies contour detection to find the contours of the identified regions. The contour with the largest area is selected to represent the detected object.
* The script calculates the distance to the detected object based on its area, and It sends signals as commands based on the image processing results to the Arduino using serial communication (The signals depend on the color and distance of the detected object).
