This is a breif description about the autonomous robot vehicle used by team 'Autonomous Buggies' in the aim of participating in WRO2023 competetion - Future Engineers category. 
 

The mechanical, electrical, and electronic parts of the vehicle can be found in the sections listed above.

The codes used to program the vehicle are written in Python and Arduino C.

## Vehicle Parts & Design
The vehicle main body is built using `LEGO`.
The main Micrprocessor in the vehicle is `Raspberry Pi 4 Model b` provided with `Raspberry pi Camera V2.1`.
Main Controller is `Arudino Mega 2060`.
In order to control & make & direct the motion of the vehicle, we used:
- Servo Motor Model:
- J Sumo DC Motor.
- BTS Motor Driver
#### The Motion Mechanism 
We used Ackermann steering and for that employed a servo motor, while the DC motor (J Sumo 300 rpm) serves as the driving motor. The kinetic energy generated by the DC motor is transferred to the back wheels through a differential gearbox. The wheels receive this energy via a drive shaft made of LEGO components, which transmits torque to the differential gearbox through a suitable coupler designed and printed by 3d printer using this [model]().

- Raspberry pi 4 Camera.
- 10 UltraSonic Sensors.
The camera was used to discover the playfield of the robot and to identify the color of the pillars existed in front of the vehicle.
The 10 Sensor were mounted as the following:
- `L1 Sensor` Left Front (Closer to the frontend of the robot).
- `L2 Sensor` Left Back (Closer to the backend of the robot).
- `R1 Sensor` Right Front (Closer to the Frontend of the robot).
- `R2 Sensor` Right Back (Closer to the backend of the robot).
- `F Sensor` Frontal Sensor (In the middle of the frontend of the robot).
- `B Sensor` Rear Sensor (In the middle of the backend of the robot).
- `BL Sensor` Back Left Sensor - mounted on the edge of the vehicle and tilted by 45 counter-clockwise degrees about the x-axis of the robot.  
- `BR Sensor` Back Right Sensor - mounted on the edge of the vehicle and tilted by 45 clockwise degrees about the x-axis of the robot.
- `FL Sensor` Front Left Sensor - mounted on the edge of the vehicle and tilted by -45 counter-clockwise degrees about the x-axis of the robot.  
- `FR Sensor` Front Right Sensor - mounted on the edge of the vehicle and tilted by -45 clockwise degrees about the x-axis of the robot.
Each sensor is fixed into a squared LEGO piece. These Sensors allow the vehicle to well follow the walls, using the equation that will be explained later.

### Power Supply
Due to the large number of electronic components used in our circuit we used a special power supply distribution using basic electronic components. The following figure illustrates the electrical
design of the following [circuit](). 
We used 2 Li-poly RC Batteries (12V – 2200mAh) as a source of power. The first one supplies the Arduino Board, Sensors, Servo motor, and DC motor; the second one supplies the Raspberry pi microprocessor. The robot is power supplied by two batteries as we mentioned before. The distribution of power is done by Three `RioRand` step-down DC-DC Converter that take their input from the batteries directly (12V input) and convert this input to (5V output). The first one supplies the raspberry pi microprocessor and its cooling fan. The second gives supply to a `bridge` which in turn supply the sensors and the gyroscope. The third supplies the servo motor. The DC motor is supplied via BTS motor driver that’s supplied directly from the batteries.
